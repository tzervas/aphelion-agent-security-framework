## üîç Component Analysis: What to Strip vs. Keep

### **AI Security Engineer Analysis**

#### **From Google ADK Parent Project - STRIP THESE COMPONENTS:**

**‚ùå UNNECESSARY - High Complexity, Low Security Value:**
1. **`/examples/servers/simple-auth/`** - Basic OAuth demo (your framework needs enterprise-grade auth)
2. **`/src/google/adk/artifacts/`** - Artifact storage services (out of scope for security framework)
3. **`/src/google/adk/tools/apihub_tool/`** - API Hub integration tools (specific to Google ecosystem)
4. **`/contributing/samples/`** - Testing samples (your framework needs custom security test cases)
5. **Development tooling** - Ruff configs, pre-commit hooks (implement your own standards)

**‚ùå UNNECESSARY - Vendor Lock-in Risk:**
1. **Google Cloud specific integrations** (`google-cloud-*` dependencies beyond ADK core)
2. **Vertex AI session services** (creates GCP dependency)
3. **GCS artifact services** (should be cloud-agnostic)
4. **Google-specific authentication flows** (conflicts with zero-trust model)

#### **From Google ADK Parent Project - KEEP & ADAPT:**

**‚úÖ ESSENTIAL - Core Security Integration:**
1. **`google-adk` core SDK** - Essential for ADK protocol handling
2. **ADK authentication patterns** - Adapt for your JWT-based auth
3. **FastAPI integration patterns** - Proven for secure API design
4. **Protocol handling abstractions** - Critical for your dispatcher design

#### **From Anthropic MCP - STRIP THESE COMPONENTS:**

**‚ùå UNNECESSARY - Feature Creep:**
1. **MCP-specific UI components** (your framework is headless security layer)
2. **Client application examples** (security framework shouldn't include demo apps)
3. **Transport protocol implementations** (use existing MCP libraries)
4. **Complex workflow examples** (keep security-focused examples only)

#### **From Anthropic MCP - KEEP & ADAPT:**

**‚úÖ ESSENTIAL - Security Integration:**
1. **MCP protocol authentication** - Critical for your unified auth layer
2. **Session management patterns** - Needed for JWT session handling
3. **Tool interaction security** - Core to your tool authorization model
4. **Error handling patterns** - Essential for security event logging

## üõ°Ô∏è DevSecOps Engineer Security Analysis

### **Security-First Component Decisions**

#### **HIGH PRIORITY - Implement These Immediately:**

1. **Zero-Trust Authentication**
   - Strip all "simple auth" examples from parent projects
   - Implement JWT-based authentication from scratch
   - Add token refresh and revocation mechanisms

2. **Dynamic Authorization Engine**
   - Keep pycasbin integration patterns from research
   - Strip vendor-specific RBAC implementations
   - Implement attribute-based access control (ABAC)

3. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - Strip parent project input handlers (security risk)
   - Implement Pydantic-based validation for all inputs
   - Add injection attack prevention

4. **Security Event Logging**
   - Strip basic logging from parent projects
   - Implement structured security event logging
   - Add real-time security monitoring integration

#### **SECURITY RISKS TO AVOID:**

‚ùå **Don't Include These from Parent Projects:**
- Pre-built authentication flows (potential vulnerabilities)
- Sample credentials or API keys
- Development/testing authentication bypasses
- Insecure default configurations
- Overly permissive CORS settings
